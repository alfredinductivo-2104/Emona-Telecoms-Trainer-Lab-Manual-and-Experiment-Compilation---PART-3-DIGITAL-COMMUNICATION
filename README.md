## INTRODUCTION

The **Emona Telecoms Trainer 101** is a device used by the students in order to learn about the different principles of **Communications and Telecommunications**. It provides a hands-on learning experience by allowing students to implement and analyze various communication system block diagrams using real hardware modules.

Through the use of the Emona Telecoms Trainer, students are able to explore key concepts in both Analog and Digital Communications such as **Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), and other fundamental communication techniques**. This hands-on approach allows students to develop a deeper understanding of how each communication system operates, from **signal generation, modulation, demodulation, filtering of the signal, amplifying, and etc**.

The compiled set of experiments documents the procedures, observations, results, and key notes for each activity. Additionally, this compilation serves as a guide for other students by providing clear references, insights, and practical tips that can help them better understand the experiments and perform them more effectively.
