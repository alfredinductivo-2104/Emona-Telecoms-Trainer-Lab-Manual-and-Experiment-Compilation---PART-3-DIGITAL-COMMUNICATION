#### 1.1 OBSERVATION



### 2. Sampling Speech



#### 2.1 OBSERVATION



### 3. Reconstructing a Message Signal



#### 3.1 OBSERVATION

## LAB QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

**Q1:What type of sampling is shown in the first part of the experiment? and What two features of the sampled signal confirm this? **


**Q2:What two features of the sampled signal confirm that the set-up models the sample-and-hold scheme?**  


**Q3: What’s the name of the distortion that appears when the VCO module’s Frequency Adjust control is turned far enough?**  


**Q4: Given the message is a 2kHz sinewave, what’s the theoretical minimum frequency for the sampling signal?**


**Q4: Why is the actual minimum sampling frequency higher than the theoretical minimum that you calculated for Question 4**
