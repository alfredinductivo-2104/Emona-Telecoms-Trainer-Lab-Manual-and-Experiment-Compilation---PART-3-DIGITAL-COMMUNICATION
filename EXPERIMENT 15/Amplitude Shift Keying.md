# AMPLITUDE SHIFT KEYING (ASK)

---

## INTRODUCTION:

Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) is a digital modulation technique used in communication systems to transmit digital data by varying the amplitude of a carrier signal. It is commonly applied in Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), where multiple users share a channel by occupying different frequency bands. In ASK, the presence or absence of the carrier or changes in its amplitude represents the digital logic levels, making it one of the simplest forms of digital modulation.

Because the envelope of an ASK signal follows the shape of the digital data, signal recovery at the receiver can be achieved using a simple envelope detector. However, this simplicity comes with a disadvantage, as ASK is highly susceptible to noise and channel interference, which can distort the signal envelope and lead to errors in data interpretation. This experiment examines the generation of ASK signals, their time-domain characteristics, and the effects of noise and channel conditions on reliable digital data transmission.

## OBJECTIVES:

In this experiment, we will be able to use the Emona Telecoms-Trainer 101 to generate an ASK signal using the switching method. Digital data for the message is modelled by the Sequence Generator module. You'll then recover the data using a simple envelope detector and observe its distortion. Finally, you'll use a comparator to restore the data

## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RESULTS:

### 1. Generating an ASK Signal 
In the first part of the experiment, we will be generating an ASK signal with 8 KHz Digital input and 2 KHz sine input at the Dual Analog Switch Module. Refer the connection to the figure and block diagram below.

#### 1.1 OBSERVATION

It is observed that the ASK signal (yellow waveform) is generated by using the digital binary sequence (red waveform) as a control signal for the Dual Analog Switch, which modulates at 2kHz sinusoidal carrier. When the digital signal is at a logic high, the switch is closed, allowing the carrier wave to pass through to the output with a measured peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) 3.920 V. Conversely, when the digital signal is at a logic low, the switch opens and the carrier is suppressed, resulting in a zero-amplitude state.

### 2. Generating an ASK Signal with VCO

In the next part of the experiment, we replace the 2KHz sine wave carrier in the analog switch with a VCO input. Refer the connection to the figure and block diagram below.

#### 2.1 OBSERVATION

It is observed that by replacing the fixed carrier with a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO), the ASK signal (yellow waveform) is generated through the switching of a high-frequency carrier under the control of the digital signal (red waveform). When the digital signal is at a logic high, the analog switch closes to output the carrier bursts, which the oscilloscope measures at a frequency of approximately 1.806kHz and a peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) of 4.080 V. When the digital signal is at a logic low, the carrier is fully suppressed, resulting in the characteristic gaps seen in the waveform.
