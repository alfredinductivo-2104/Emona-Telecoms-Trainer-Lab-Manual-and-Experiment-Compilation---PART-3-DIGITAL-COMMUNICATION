# AMPLITUDE SHIFT KEYING (ASK)

---

## INTRODUCTION:

Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) is a digital modulation technique used in communication systems to transmit digital data by varying the amplitude of a carrier signal. It is commonly applied in Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), where multiple users share a channel by occupying different frequency bands. In ASK, the presence or absence of the carrier or changes in its amplitude represents the digital logic levels, making it one of the simplest forms of digital modulation.

Because the envelope of an ASK signal follows the shape of the digital data, signal recovery at the receiver can be achieved using a simple envelope detector. However, this simplicity comes with a disadvantage, as ASK is highly susceptible to noise and channel interference, which can distort the signal envelope and lead to errors in data interpretation. This experiment examines the generation of ASK signals, their time-domain characteristics, and the effects of noise and channel conditions on reliable digital data transmission.

## OBJECTIVES:

In this experiment, we will be able to use the Emona Telecoms-Trainer 101 to generate an ASK signal using the switching method. Digital data for the message is modelled by the Sequence Generator module. You'll then recover the data using a simple envelope detector and observe its distortion. Finally, you'll use a comparator to restore the data

## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RESULTS:

### 1. Generating an ASK Signal 
In the first part of the experiment, we will be generating an ASK signal with 8 KHz Digital input and 2 KHz sine input at the Dual Analog Switch Module. Refer the connection to the figure and block diagram below.

#### 1.1 OBSERVATION

It is observed that the ASK signal (yellow waveform) is generated by using the digital binary sequence (red waveform) as a control signal for the Dual Analog Switch, which modulates at 2kHz sinusoidal carrier. When the digital signal is at a logic high, the switch is closed, allowing the carrier wave to pass through to the output with a measured peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) 3.920 V. Conversely, when the digital signal is at a logic low, the switch opens and the carrier is suppressed, resulting in a zero-amplitude state.

### 2. Generating an ASK Signal with VCO

In the next part of the experiment, we replace the 2KHz sine wave carrier in the analog switch with a VCO input. Refer the connection to the figure and block diagram below.

#### 2.1 OBSERVATION

It is observed that by replacing the fixed carrier with a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO), the ASK signal (yellow waveform) is generated through the switching of a high-frequency carrier under the control of the digital signal (red waveform). When the digital signal is at a logic high, the analog switch closes to output the carrier bursts, which the oscilloscope measures at a frequency of approximately 1.806kHz and a peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) of 4.080 V. When the digital signal is at a logic low, the carrier is fully suppressed, resulting in the characteristic gaps seen in the waveform.

### 3. Demodulating an ASK Signal using an Envelope Detector

In the next part of the experiment, the generated ASK signal will be recovered using an AM demodulation scheme. This part uses an envelope detector to demodulate the ASK signal. Refer to the connection shown in the figure and block diagram below.

#### 3.1 OBSERVATION

It is observed that the demodulated ASK signal (yellow waveform) is recovered from the modulated carrier by passing it through an envelope detector consisting of a rectifier and a tuneable low-pass filter. On the oscilloscope, the yellow waveform shows a recovered version of the binary sequence with a peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) of approximately 6.160V, exhibiting a slight ripple and slanted edges due to the filter's charging and discharging characteristics.

### 4. Restoring the recovered digital signal using a comparator

In the last part of the experiment, allows us to use a comparator to clean up the demodulated ASK signal and to be able to restore it properly. Refer to the connection shown in the figure and block diagram below.

#### 4.1 OBSERVATION

It is observed that the restored digital signal (yellow waveform) is generated by passing the output of the envelope detector through a comparator circuit, which squares up the waveform to match the original binary sequence (red waveform). On the oscilloscope, the yellow waveform appears as a clean, sharp-edged square wave with a peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) of 5.20 V, successfully recreating the logic levels of the original data. Despite a measurable frequency difference in the display's auto readout likely due to the high-frequency switching artifacts of the 100kHz carrier, the visual alignment between the red input pulses and the yellow output pulses confirms that the digital information has been accurately recovered and restored to its baseband form

## LAB QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

**Q1: What is the relationship between the digital signal and the presence of the carrier in the ASK Signal?**

- The digital signal controls the presence of the carrier.
- When the digital signal is logic 1, the carrier is present at the output.
- When the digital signal is logic 0, the carrier is suppressed or turned off.

**Q2: What is the ASK signal's voltage when the digital signal is logic 0?**  

When the digital signal is logic 0, the ASK signal has approximately 0 V amplitude, since the carrier is disconnected by the analog switch.

**Q3: What feature of the ASK Signal suggests that it's an AM Signal?**  

The envelope of the ASK signal follows the shape of the digital data. The carrier’s amplitude varies while its frequency remains constant, which is characteristic of amplitude modulation (AM).

**Q4: Why is the recovered digital signal not a perfect copy of the original?**

The envelope detector introduces ripple and slow rise/fall times due to the charging and discharging of the filter capacitor. Noise and filtering effects slightly distort the signal, preventing perfect reconstruction.

**Q5: What can be used to "Clean up" the recovered digital signal?**

A comparator can be used to clean up the recovered signal by restoring sharp logic transitions and fixed logic levels.

**Q6: How does the comparator turn the slow rising voltage of the recovered digital signal into sharp transitions?**

The comparator switches its output state whenever the input crosses a fixed reference voltage. This converts gradual voltage changes into fast transitions between logic high and logic low.

## CONCLUSIONS:
After analyzing the gathered data and observations about Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), the following conclusions have been made:
- Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) transmits digital data by switching the amplitude of a carrier signal according to the digital input.
- ASK can be easily generated using a digital control signal and an analog switch.
- The envelope of the ASK signal directly represents the digital data, allowing simple demodulation using an envelope detector.
- Envelope detection successfully recovers the baseband digital signal but introduces distortion and ripple.
- Noise and filtering effects prevent the recovered signal from being an exact replica of the original digital data.
- A comparator effectively restores the recovered signal by reshaping it into clean, well-defined logic levels
- ASK offers simplicity in implementation but is highly susceptible to noise and channel interference compared to other digital modulation techniques.
