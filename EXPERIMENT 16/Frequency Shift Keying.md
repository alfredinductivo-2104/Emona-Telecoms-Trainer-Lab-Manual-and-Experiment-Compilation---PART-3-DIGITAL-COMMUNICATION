## LAB QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

**Q1: What is the relationship between the digital signal and the presence of the carrier in the ASK Signal?**



**Q2: What is the ASK signal's voltage when the digital signal is logic 0?**  


**Q3: What feature of the ASK Signal suggests that it's an AM Signal**  


**Q4: Why is the recovered digital signal not a perfect copy of the original?**


**Q5: What can be used to "Clean up" the recovered digital signal?**


**Q6: How does the comparator turn the slow rising voltage of the recovered digital signal into sharp transitions?**
