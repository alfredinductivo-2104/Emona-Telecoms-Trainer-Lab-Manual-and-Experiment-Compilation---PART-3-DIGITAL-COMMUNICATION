## Lab Questions

**Q1: In what way is the Adder module's output different from the original 2 kHz sine?**  

**Q2: What feature of the Multiplier output suggests it is an AM signal?**  

**Q3: Is one of the signals in the AM complex a 2 kHz sine wave?**  

**Q4: Why is there a signal out of the Multiplier even when not speaking (Speech module)?**
